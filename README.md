"# Starbucks-mimic"
# My first niche e-commerce website for hands on practice 
Welcome to the Starbucks Clone e-commerce website repository! This project is an imitation of an e-commerce website inspired by Starbucks. While it doesn't match the real Starbucks website, it highlights fundamental web development skills like array manipulation , local storage etc. and provides basic functionalities for users to explore .
üí° Why I Built This
# I built this Starbucks clone to:
Practice front-end development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
to get hands on practice with javascript array manipulation like filter,find,for each , local storage to dynamicaaly add items to cart and regex (regular expressions)
Experiment with basic backend login functionality using Node.js
Understand how to structure a simple e-commerce platform
Create a niche website inspired by the Starbucks brand
üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a front-end-focused e-commerce website with a little custom design and basic functionality. The purpose of building this site was to get hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a basic backend login system using Node.js.
Key Features:
Home Page: A custom landing page with a Starbucks-inspired design.
order Page: Display of coffee products with options to add them to a shopping cart.
Cart Functionality: Users can add and view products .
Login Page: A simple, hard-coded login system that accepts only admin as the username and password as the password to authenticate or you can login as a guest
While the website works normally, it doesn't replicate all the features of a real e-commerce platform, and some sections (like payment) are not yet implemented.
 # Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript (ES6)
Node.js (for backend login functionality)
üìù Future Improvements
This project is a work-in-progress, and I plan to implement the following features in the future:
Full-fledged authentication system (replacing hard-coded login)
Cart and payment integration (not yet implemented)
Dynamic product pages with more information
Enhanced UI/UX for a more polished look
Backend integration for order and payment processing
